## Development server
- First, in order to get the server up and firing data, open a terminal and navigate into the server folder. Run an `npm install`. Then run the command `node server.js`. The server should now be listening at localhost:8082.

- Next, open a second terminal and navigate to the client/cavern folder. Run an `npm install`. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
